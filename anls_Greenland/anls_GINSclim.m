% Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas Regional Climatology version 2 (GINS RC v2)
% https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/regional_climate/gin-seas-climate/about_gin.html
% The GINS RC v2 is a set of six decadal mean fields for temperature and 
% salinity within the 50째N and 85째N and 45째W to 15째E domain comprising 
% the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas and adjacent 
% areas of the northern North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. 
% The six decadal climatologies of temperature and salinity use 
% all data available in WOD13 from 1955 to 2012. 
% There are five 10-year 
% (1955-1964, 1965-1974, 1975-1984, 1985-1994, and 1995-2004) 
% climatologies and an 8-year (2005-2012) climatology 
% that were calculated for annual, seasonal, 
% and monthly time periods. 
% Seasons are as follows: Winter (January-March), Spring (April-June), 
% Summer (July-September), and Fall (October-December). 
% Additionally, there is a 58-year climatology defined 
% as "all averaged decades," which was computed by 
% averaging all six decadal climatologies and 
% represents the long-term mean state of the ocean in the GINS region.
